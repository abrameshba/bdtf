Benchmark datasets for team formation problem

Team formation problem gained focus from Data mining, Artificial Intelliegence, social network research communities from last decade. 
The skeleton version of team formation problem is to find set of experts for a given task who are collaborative. 
Assuming easy communication leads to collaboration, mathematically is to minimize the communication effort. 
Upon this project total budget, team members personal cost, workload of each member, load balancing among members, multiple experts for a skill 
and few other dimensions are added to the team formation problem.

For each of these most considered DBLP, bibsonomy, github, imdb, stackoverflow, and few other datasets.
There is no either standard dataset or standard procedure to assessand evaluate the team formation algorithms.

team formation algorithms performance is verified against tasks 
1. comprising randomly selected skills.
2. consisting of skills selected based on experts availability.
